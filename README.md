# Stock-Market-Forecasting-and-Trading-Strategy-Generation

This project focuses on predicting future stock returns and assessing associated risks using machine learning. It involves constructing a comprehensive dataset from financial indicators, historical stock prices, and economic data. Six machine learning models are engineered, trained, and evaluated for stock prediction, with a focus on model optimization and performance evaluation. Multiple trading strategies are also developed and backtested to maximize profitability and minimize risk.

## Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Dataset Construction**: Integrated financial indicators, historical stock prices, and economic data to create a rich feature set for stock return prediction and risk assessment.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained six machine learning models, including **Ridge Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** using scikit-learn.
- **Model Optimization**: Enhanced model performance through feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous backtesting.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated model accuracy and robustness using performance metrics such as **RMSE** and **accuracy**, with comparisons across different training and testing periods.
- **Trading Strategy Development**: Developed and backtested multiple trading strategies, focusing on maximizing profitability while minimizing drawdowns and risks.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation, model training, and backtesting.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning model development, including Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and performance evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model prototyping.
